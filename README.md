This is a sample application accompanying my blog post related to unit testing and mocking persistence in a Spring/Hibernate environment.

Usage
-----

The assumption is that Maven is configured and pointing to a Java 8 JDK.

```
    $ git clone https://github.com/ntobeko/proxy-inject-example.git
    $ cd proxy-inject-example
    $ mvn clean install
```
